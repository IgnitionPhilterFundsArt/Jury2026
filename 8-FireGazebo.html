            <h1>8 - Fire Gazebo</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>The fire gazebo is a place of power, gathering, and reflection. Participants approach a glowing structure greeted by solar lanterns hanging around and reflecting patterns on the ground. They enter through one of two entrances to find a relaxation area of rugs and cushions with backboards to lean against around the sides of the structure. In the center is a small altar and hanging above a chandelier. The roof of the gazebo glows with a continuous flame effect running along each bar at the top. Participants look around and see prayer/thought/poetry/manifestation cards on each of the 8 posts of the gazebo accompanied by an item/d"cor. Four of the 8 gazebo posts also have a button that when pushed triggers one of four high pressure propane effect to go off overhead.</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>I have a generator/solar powered when not running</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>Safety plan includes leak testing all components, multiple easily accessible shut off valves in each system, having a trained sober operator on site at all times the project is running, fire extinguisher, appropriate distance of fuel station from ignition, and meeting any other safety standards set forth by the event.</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>The planning stage is complete, I have purchased the base gazebo frame. Creation will begin in March and will happen by me at my house during my free time leading up until Flipside. I plan to do early arrival with DaFT and will allocate time I am not volunteering with DaFT to get the project set up and installed. I will break down the project and remove it on Monday post event, or possibly tear down on Sunday to load out on Monday depending on if I have volunteers to help with tear down.</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>I brought a flaming 4 post king sized bed to Freezerburn in 2025. It had a continuous flame effect around the top and 4 high pressure flame effects (one on each corner). It went really well! I loved doing it and the fire gazebo is the natural progression of that art project for me. I also volunteered with the Flaming Lotus Girls at Burning Man in 2025 installing their most recent project Haven. Other projects (not in this medium) I have completed at burns include the blacklight mini golf course I built for Flipside 2024 (and received a grant for) as well as many, many years on DaFT.</p>

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>$1,000</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>$2,500</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Description</h3>
            <p>I would reduce the amount of flame effects on the project. I understand that I will be funding the majority of the project myself regardless of the budget level, which is why I am asking for the maximum amount of funding.</p>
        
            <h3>Previous Funding</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>
