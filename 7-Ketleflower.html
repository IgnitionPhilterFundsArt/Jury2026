            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>Ketleflower is a light and sound installation inspired by bioluminescence and the comfort of shared, restful space. The piece takes the form of a large sunflower, roughly twelve feet across including petals, built from lightweight materials and illuminated with individually addressable LEDs. It is paired with an immersive sound environment that blends original music with surround sound field recordings of natural environments from the region.

Ketleflower got its start at Engulf  where it has been installed and reinstalled over the course of several years, evolving each time through use, repair, and community feedback. Those outings shaped the piece into what it is now: less about spectacle, and more about offering a place where people can simply be together.

At Flipside, Flipizens interact with Ketleflower by inhabiting the space it creates. People sit, lie down, cuddle, talk quietly, nap, or just breathe for a while within the light and sound. Some folks have deeply personal, reflective experiences, while others enjoy it casually as a cozy place to land, and both ways of engaging are completely valid. The piece asks very little of participants and gives them room to decide how they want to be with it.

This proposal is for the original DIY version of Ketleflower. Grant funding would support transportation, setup and takedown help, routine repairs, and expanded seating and lounging options to make the space more comfortable and welcoming for y"all throughout the event.

Ketleflower offers a gentle, grounding counterpoint to higher energy experiences on the playa. It"s a place to rest, reconnect, and share quiet moments together, shaped as much by the community as by the object itself.</p>

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>would like to be there a day or two before gates, and uninstall on the last day</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>�ve completed a number of large scale light based and immersive art projects over the years, many of them outdoors and in festival or public settings.

Ketleflower itself started as a DIY piece at Engulf and has been installed there multiple times over several years. Each time it�s gone out, I�ve learned something new about durability, weather, transport, setup time, and how people actually use the space. Those repeat installations allowed the piece to evolve gradually and reliably, rather than trying to build something overly complicated all at once.

A permanent steel version of Ketleflower was later installed along the Lafitte Greenway in New Orleans as a public artwork and lighting element. That project involved working with fabricators and navigating long term maintenance, which reinforced the importance of building things that are sturdy, serviceable, and realistic to care for over time.

I�ve also built and collaborated on large scale illuminated sculptures, parade elements, and immersive environments through Interrobang, a New Orleans based collaborative group I founded in 2014. Many of those projects combine light, sound, performance, and community participation.

The biggest lessons I�ve learned are to keep systems simple, build with real world conditions in mind, plan for setup and repair, and leave room for people to make the piece their own. All of that directly informs how Ketleflower is built, installed, and cared for at events like Flipside.</p>

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>575</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>I'm probably going to end up coming out of pocket even with the $575, and it's a beast to load up, then drive from New Orleans, then it's a beast to install.  Then doing it all in reverse.  I'd really appreciate getting the full $575.  Ask anyone whose been to Engulf this year or last (poolboy, winnie) they'll tell you, it's a really lovely piece and is rather beloved at Engulf. Hoping I can share those special moments with lots of new folks!</p>
