            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>Tetra Light is the first stage of my complex LED light structure, assembled from led light strips in tubing. The model is my design and I have made different versions, sizes, and even have computer models to allow for more advanced programming. Audio reactive modes are beautiful, but the model also holds a higher function in my mind"s eye where I see the light moving and flowing through 48 segments. Tetra light is stage 1 of 12 segments by doubling the 6 edge curves of a tetrahedron. This features 3 light strips and 1 controller.

I have submitted photos as demonstrations of the larger size tubing and light, and also two variations of the 9 inch model. In building a one meter version, the led strips used will have 160 lights per meter in small " inch tubing. I have plans to build bigger versions and also more complex versions. For Tetra Light, I started with a yard size using " inch tubes at length of 5 feet, and I also made a 20 inch version with all 48 segments, before I started working on simple models for testing from software. 

The complete model of four stages makes up a multiple dimensional tetrahedron, which I describe as a cross-dimensional star. I"m using usb controllers running WLED to power the lights in smaller models. I"m working on different scales for materials and cost analysis. I currently have a 10 inch model in the photos and a couple aquapex tubes for 1 meter light strip testing. I am including links for my IG reels and YT channel for videos.

I have videos relating to the normal use of WLED in my smaller models and the larger yard model was using Govee light strips. I also have videos of the audio reactive visualizer demonstrating programming I am building in Touchdesigner. 

The complex model of stages 1-4 combines four times more parts than the simple stage one like Tetra Light. This will be more than audio reactive and standard WLED programming. I am programming patterns and light movements in Touchdesigner.  I have examples where I am able to stream from TD to the WLED controller. I have already tested the small tetra light from TD and can demonstrate this as requested.

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>I plan to use a portable battery pack for smaller scale and possibly a prtable battery backup or generator for more power.</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>** not provided **</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>In Progress (Making Changes)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>For the proposed 1 meter model of 12 pieces, I plan to make this a packable set. The tubing and light strips are modular so it can be setup on site and torn down for transport. I plan to make end caps in various materials from 3D printing, but tape will suffice for temporary construction. The complex model, in the future, will be many more parts to assemble and would likely require a vehicle for transport or permanent venue.</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>I have built 5 foot models for my front porch and yard, and these even had a stand or slits to set them floating off the ground. I have plans to build bigger at around 3 meter or larger using regular 10mm light strips at 60 led per meter. I start with a 3 foot model in 2020 that wasn't lit, then 5 foot lighted model in 2023, then down to smaller models for material testing in 2024 and 2025. I have been doing a lot of parts and programming testing with smaller scale under a meter. I learned a lot about how to better plan for weatherizing the larger models for outdoor use. I've also been considering how to make the tetra light unit packable and shippable for selling; easily assembled with 3d printed brackets, tube, light strips all being in a set.</p>

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>334</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>$300 covers general parts and material for assemble.</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Description</h3>
            <p>There are better material and assembly methods like weatherizing that would be left out for cheaper version. I coudl also build it on half the lights with one strip per tube.</p>
