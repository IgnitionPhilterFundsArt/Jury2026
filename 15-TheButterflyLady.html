            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>This piece is a continuation on my previous work in puppetry and interactive art. This sculpture is a crank style puppet with poseable limbs and moveable wings. The limbs will be built out of plywood in the style of a paper puppet. The wings will have the crank mechanism allowing the viewer to play with the sculpture and bring it to life.  I love creating supernatural creatures, it is very nostalgic because I grew up creating my own creatures and making paper puppets . I"m hoping to bring my previous puppet and the two pieces can interact with each other adding to the whimsical experience!</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>** not provided **</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>My art piece will include wooden moveable pieces. My safety plan is to make sure all the hardware pieces are tightly secured and to check the piece through out the event. I also think it�s important to have backup hardware in case something is damaged. It might also be helpful to have a sign that encourages the viewers to interact gently so the piece doesn�t get damaged.</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>Deadline 
mid February-  purchase supplies
February-march - make template, cut plywood , paint plywood , and add painted details to puppet
Mid march - test mechanism and add varnish to make weather resistant 
April 23rd  - install at Flipside (takes about 30mins -hour) to ensure there�s no trace I will check the installation site during installation and during removal. 
April 27th uninstall piece 
</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I made a similar sculpture for Flipside 2025. I�ve made Full body costume/sculptures out of trash and found objects. I�ve also made several medium to large size sculptures (metal) In high school and college. I don�t have documentation of all my work but most of these pieces took several weeks. 

The sculpture/puppet I made last year was very successful, people Interacted with it and enjoyed it just how I intended! I think the lessons I�ve learned from all of these projects is to have better time management so I don�t rush and also to always have backup hardware and supplies to repair (Especially interactive pieces.) </p>

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>$210</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>$190</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Description</h3>
            <p>If I couldn�t receive the full budget, I would probably try to make the piece a little bit smaller so I could use less plywood. Alternatively I could try to find scrap metal for the support stakes which is one of the more expensive cost of the project. </p>
