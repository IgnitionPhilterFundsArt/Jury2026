            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>This piece will be hanging 3 dimensional collage art, integrated with LEDs. I've created two pieces based on this general concept so far, and learned a lot in their creation.  These will be built almost entirely from second hand materials sourced from the Goodwill bins - crochet blankets and scarves, beads, pom poms, mini stuffed animals, wooden beads and scraps, etc. One prototype piece was built on three long steel cable strands 10' long, to accommodate easy ceiling mounted hanging in a standard 10'x10' square of 1" EMT conduit shade structure, the other was built on a 6' long folding portable soccer goal. There are aspects of both which work well, but for this piece I'd like to create using simple hoops (possibly pre--made hula hoops, but I may make the hoops myself from second hand tubing stock if I can find it). Across each hoop (4 hoops total) I will stretch knit crocheted blankets, netting, and organically install clumps of 12mm addressable LEDS. LEDs will be powered with open source software (WLED), running through calming, colorful, shifting patterns designed and customized by me. Throughout the piece(s) there will be repeating elements throughout arranged in patterns and organically spreading. Color scheme will be muted, pastel shades, earth tones, and wood grains. LED color scheme and patterns will match and coordinate. The piece will hang from a 10'x10' EMT conduit structure, and will provide a comfortable place for viewers to take in the space, relax, and enjoy. I want people who enter and spend time underneath the piece to feel cozy, protected, and nostalgic. One aspect of this art is that I was motivated to use materials and LED systems that are robust, durable, and reliable. It breaks my heart to see burn camp LED strands get tossed in the trash after just a couple years. The 12mm bullet LEDs have the entire chip and LED encased in solid epoxy, making them very robust, and in addition to that, include wiring which allows the data and power signal to move on, even if one light is damaged, the rest of the strand will work. They will be zip tied securely, and wrapped with wool strips for protection.  Another small aspect of the project will be it being completely battery and solar powered, with an accompanying informational plaque detailing it's solar setup. I want to encourage more burners to feel like investing in a solar setup to power their camps and art is affordable, normal, and expected.

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>It will be powered via solar panel and lifepo4 battery. I already have a sufficient battery, but could use some assistance purchasing a small solar panel to recharge during the day. Committed to not using generator power, and making small solar setups more common/normal/expected. </p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>In Progress (Making Changes)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>Planning and two proof of concept pieces have been created already, so the design is solid and works. I will need a couple weeks/trips to the goodwill bins to source crotched pieces and decorative elements. Creation per hoop/loop from start to finish is about 1-2 weeks with 2 artists working - assuming materials are already acquired and is just wiring the leds and gluing/connecting the decorative elements. I would like to create 4 hoops, so creation time will be approx 6 weeks. Setup time with a couple extra volunteers can be completed in 2 hours or less. On site is simple, hanging and plugging in the connections. Removal is also simple and fast. </p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>I am mostly familiar with hanging printed media/painted canvas type art, but do have some experience hanging sculptures and LED art. I created and mounted 4 collage sculpture pieces for Flipside 2024, and have hung and mounted my LED collages at several other events (Burnmas 2025 was one of them!) </p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Description</h3>
            <p>2 Hoops instead of 4, approximately 50% cost. </p>
