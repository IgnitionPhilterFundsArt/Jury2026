            <h1>9 - The Boobth</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>This project is an interactive and inclusive "breast exam" booth where Flipizens can come to receive effusive compliments about their breasts (it"s both complimentary and free), but no actual medical advice. Boobth visitors will ring the bell and one of our camp members will meet them in a lab coat and invite them into the Boobth for their exam. Consent is obtained, and either a tactile or ocular breast exam is offered. Afterward, the Boobth visitor is given the option to get a polaroid taken of their breasts that will be displayed within the Boobth for the duration of the festival. Flipizens will have the opportunity to pick up their polaroid before the end of the festival, and any remaining photos will be burned in the effigy. 

The Boobth itself will be made of a tri-fold wooden frame and plywood walls. The inside and outside walls will be covered in boob centric artwork, with one of the inside walls covered in a cork board to put up the polaroids. There will be a red velvet curtain running across the front of the Boobth for any privacy requested during the "exam". 

This installation was present at our camp, Dyke Spa, last year and it was incredibly popular! Unfortunately, the Boobth was constructed out of fairly flimsy MDF and peg board, and the weather took a toll on it over time. I have included two pictures of the Boobth's first iteration from last year in my images to give you an idea of the prototype. This year, we would like to construct it out of more durable and attractive materials that will stand the test of time.

            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>I have been completing large scale furniture projects since I began woodworking in 2020. I have a fully outfitted home shop with all the tools necessary to complete large and complex projects. Some of my favorite projects over the years have been a custom walnut dining table, cherry night stands, and a white oak entertainment center. In addition, I built the first iteration of the Boobth for Flipside 2025 and would like to use the same general design but build it better for 2026.

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>$300</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>$200</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Description</h3>
            <p>I would reduce the number of paint colors used to decorate the outside of the boobth, I would remove the lights so it would not be as visible at night, I would use string instead of the cork board to hang the polaroids. </p>
