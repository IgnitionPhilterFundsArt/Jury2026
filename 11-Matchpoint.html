            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>A few years ago I started tiny sculptures out of matches. Initially, it was because of chronic pain in my hands which kept me from painting as much as I wanted to, but it quickly became its own thing and make the sculptures with the attention to burn them.

This project is actually a demonstration of the Bhagavad Gita.  "Relinquish attachment to the fruits of your labor;" Has freed me from anxiety about what happens when the piece is done.

Duality of working on a small portable project(making small panels one by one) that is simultaneously a project that"s bigger than the person making it has shifted my perspective intrinsically.

Working on art with no attachment to "having" the art at completion (to sell or just to hoard) has profoundly changed my creative process in every medium I work in.  

The piece I am bringing to flipside is getting bigger everyday. I aim to have 100,000 matchsticks by the time we burn it.  Matchpoint is for everyone.   I want as many people as possible to build panels to add to it.  

We"ve been working on it at church night and that"s great, but I now want to invite all flipizens to build a panel or more, so we can burn it together.   :).  

The "cake topper" is at the wherehouse, but we will assemble the whole piece at flipside. We need a spot where it"s safe to build it and burn it, and need yall to advise on perimeter and when is the best time to burn it.  I will have modular shelving set up so people can leave their panels to dry.   

Also will have a chill hangout spot with a variety of physical therapy stuff (theragun, foam roller, etc) so people can adjust themselves or each other. I have chronic pain and am hypermobile so Having this stuff at camp has been amazing. I want to share the wealth. </p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Maybe</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>I have a small jackery and solar panel that I think will be sufficient but it has come to my attention that this is cartoonishly small.  I think that ca manage lighting etc without additional power but am open to better ideas from other people.  ;)</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>Safety plan is - no smoking at Matchpoint, and really I need help from the burnable art lead to figure out perimeter and security there considerations. </p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>In Progress (Making Changes)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>Hope to set up as soon as we�re allowed to start set up.  :).  After we burn it i will carry out the ash with the rest of my setup.  </p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>I�ve built and burned many of theses sculptures but have never been so ambitious in scale.   The largest had about 10000 sticks on it.  </p>

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>$510</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>There is no minimum amount.  I�m building this and bringing it.  I don�t have very much money so if I can�t get the shelving I�ll have to figure something else out.  Anything helps. I�m sorry I decline to make a real spreadsheet.  Excel makes me crazy</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Description</h3>
            <p>Less shelving will be the compromise </p>
        
            <h3>Previous Funding</h3>
            <p>No</p>
