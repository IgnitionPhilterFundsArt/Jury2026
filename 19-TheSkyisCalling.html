            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>The Vision"
"The Sky is Calling" is an interactive, sound-responsive light installation designed to transform the auditory landscape of Flipside into a communal visual experience. The project consists of three 12-foot upright supports (structural bamboo) forming a 15-foot equilateral triangle. Suspended at varying heights within this footprint via high-tension airline cable is a "canopy" of six glowing halos. These "Rainbow Rings" range from 2" to 6" in diameter.

The Interaction: The "Flipizen Experience""
This installation acts as a visual megaphone for the community. Using high-sensitivity sound sensors, the "Rainbow Rings" respond in real-time to the most radical of expressions. Whether a Flipizen claps, clucks, hoops, howls, or laughs, the rings ignite with cascading color and intensity.
By rewarding unbridled vocal experimentation with a dazzling display of light, we create a feedback loop that invites every passerby to join in. Here, ONE becomes US in a shared chorus of cackles and cries. The social barriers that restrict us in the default world disappear, as individual noise inspires the collective into a light show for all.

Technical & Safety Execution"
To ensure the jury"s funds are used effectively and safely, we are utilizing:
 " High-Density COB LED Strips: Chosen for a "dot-free," seamless neon glow that looks professional and high-end.
 "  Structural Integrity: The canopy is suspended using 1/8" stainless steel aircraft cable. The 12-foot poles are secured in weighted bases and anchored with heavy-duty earth augers to withstand Texas winds.
 "  Safety & LNT: All guy-wires will be flagged with high-visibility neon ribbon and reflective tape for nighttime safety. The project is entirely "Plug-and-Play," meaning no on-site soldering or "micro-moop" creation.
 "  Mitigation: Applying key insights from our previous large-scale builds, we have intentionally simplified the structural load and reduced mechanical complexity for this installation. We have implemented strict internal deadlines (including a full-scale dress rehearsal 10 days prior to the event) to ensure the piece is 'plug-and-play' and fully operational for the community by the first night of the burn.

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>The installation will run primarily on a high-capacity Battery/Inverter system to ensure silent operation and preserve the auditory environment for participant vocalization. An existing, owner-provided quiet inverter generator�housed in a noise-reducing baffle�will be used strictly as a backup or for recharging. Power is distributed via outdoor-rated extension cords protected by high-visibility cable covers. The 'Rainbow Rings' utilize a low-voltage DC system (12V/24V). All electronics and power supplies are housed in ventilated, IP65-rated weatherproof enclosures. While the rings are suspended 8 feet out of reach, the use of low-voltage components ensures the installation is inherently touch-safe. For added safety, an inline GFCI will be used at the source, and the backup generator will be placed on a secondary containment tray to ensure Leave No Trace (LNT) compliance.</p>

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>Project Timeline: The Sky is Calling

Phase 1: Procurement & Initial Fabrication (February 1 � February 28)
� Feb 15: All long-lead technical components (COB LEDs, controllers, and structural bamboo) are ordered.
� Feb 28: All structural materials (bamboo, cable, anchors) are on-site in default world for inspection and initial sizing.

Phase 2: Technical Integration (March 1 � March 31)
� March 10: Fabrication of the six "Rainbow Rings" complete. All electronics are soldered, "Tech-Flex" shrouded, and weather-sealed.
� March 25: Coding and Sound-to-Light calibration finalized on the microcontrollers to ensure the "cluck-to-color" response is tuned.

Phase 3: The Readiness Milestone (April 1 � April 11)
� Saturday, April 11: Full-Scale Dress Rehearsal. Complete off-site assembly in Dallas. We will erect the tripod structure, tension the canopy, and test the power/sensor system in a real-world environment. This ensures a 100% "plug-and-play" installation on the land.

Phase 4: On-Site Installation (April 23)
� Thursday, April 23: Morning, if early load in is an option. If not will arrive at opening of gates for unload. Upright erection, and canopy tensioning will be completed in a single afternoon session, all prior to setting up our campsite.
� Sunset: The Skies Call . . . we FLIP on the switch.
� Daily Operations: The piece will be active for participant interaction from Dusk until Midnight each night.

Phase 5: Strike & LNT Removal (Sunday, April 26 � Monday, April 27)
� Sunday Night (Post-Midnight): System strike begins (3-hour estimated duration).
� Monday Morning: Final 20-foot radius "grid-sweep" for LNT compliance. All materials loaded for transport; site returned to original condition.</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>Project History & Lessons�
Yes, I�ve completed several large-scale projects over the years. In 2018, I assisted Camp Illumination with a lighting show at To the Moon in Tennessee, which was a brilliant success. In 2023, we sailed into Myschievia with a 30-foot ghost ship, complete with a light and laser show helmed by a gigantic Captain Skelly. It was smooth sailing and a crowd favorite.

However, not every install goes perfectly. Myschievia 2024 was a massive learning curve. "RACKREATION: 4 Rooms 4 Play" was simply two rooms too many. Between a last-minute relocation to center stage (thank you Land) and a grueling two-day install on full display, I nearly killed my crew. We got it done, but it wasn't pretty.

I took those lessons to heart for Myschievia 2025. We brought our A-game with a laser show that was phenomenal and went off without a hitch.

The Lesson�
The biggest thing I�ve learned is the danger of over-committing. I now know how to better gauge the scale of a project against the reality of the clock and the capacity of my crew. As I always say, "It�s not a burn unless you learn," and 2024 taught me exactly where to draw the line to ensure a high-quality, professional show and that my gang returns.</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Description</h3>
            <p>While maintaining all the safety features and LNT protocol, the install would have a reduced number of rings. Not preferable, but feasible.</p>
