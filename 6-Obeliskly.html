            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>The art piece will be a 10 foot tall 4 sided obelisk with a 2.5 foot square base built from wood. Each side of the obelisk will represent a cultish style group that relates to our camp.  The sides will be ornately cut out and include symbols that are associated with the corresponding group. Each side will be painted and include information about each group and its meaning. The side with the Cult of You will painted with chalk board paint and will encourage viewers to tells us who they are one with. At night the obelisk will be back lit from the inside to provide a beacon for weary travelers to rest at our camp and a light to guide our campers home. Participants may engage with the art piece by learning about...., and also teaching us about the groups that they belong to. At the end of the event the obelisk will be ceremoniously pitched into the embers of the effigy,  Additionally next to the Obelisk will be a bell that may rung each time someone expresses gratitude for being part of a collective. The bell will be a hanging large gas cylinder that will be on a supported steel structure.   </p>

            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>I have built a burnable art piece to display in font of Pyro H3 for the last 5 years. Last year was the 8' by 5' wedge of cheese called Queso de Tejas. I have also constructed 2 effigies for separate hash campouts, the largest being a 12 foot tall 40 oz Old English bottle that was climbable.  All projects to date have been sturdy and held up to the test of hashers and burners engagement. Lessons that I have learned is if we intended to burn an art piece we make sure that we use appropriate non-toxic materials. I have also built a pergola lots of metal sculpture, furniture, sheds,.....  I am an engineer by trade. </p>
