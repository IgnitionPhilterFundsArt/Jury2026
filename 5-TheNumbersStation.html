            <h1>5 - The Numbers Station</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>The Numbers Station is a 15 ft tall freestanding solar powered obelisk.
The tower is constructed of 3/4 inch steel EMT conduit starting at an approx 12 inch wide base and tapering to approx 6 inches at the top.  The tower breaks down into sections for easy transport.  The tower is supported by a heavy wooden base constructed of 2x6 wood panels 5 feet across, bolted to the ground playa style, and counterweighted in the base.  The system is designed to concentrate the center of mass as low as possible to safely stand without the need for guy wires or heavy equipment to set up.  The relatively narrow tower reduces weight and surface area for wind.  Lag bolts into the ground complete the base structure.    The tower is clad with laser cut wooden sheets with diffuser backing and (tbd) magnetically attaches to the tower skeleton.  The panels contain various occult glyphs and icons and are lit by LED strips hidden within the tower (some of these design elements are not yet rendered so the concept art looks more basic than it will be, also it will probably be black, not bare wood). Completing the tower is a small 3D printed pyramid at the apex that lights up. The obelisk is solar powered with panels attached the base. If time permits, we hope to have sound effects (actual numbers stations, etc!), along with motion/presence detection.

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>Built in solar power!</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>Safety notes: 
There is no flame, no moving parts, and no fuels.
The solar power/battery system has multiple layers of safety components and is built on battle tested hardware and software that powers a fleet of art projects deployed regularly at local burns.  Fuses, thermal regulation, fan cooling, overcurrent and overcharge protection are all built in to the power system.

The imposing height of the tower is mitigated by using light weight construction on the tower itself, concentrating most of the weight in the base (including counter weighting if needed - a technique we used successfully on SunStreak), a wide and strong wooden base, and playa-style lag bolting into the ground.</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>
Mid February: complete major design elements (tower design and cladding)
Late February: order parts and begin tower construction
March: complete tower
Late March: complete cladding
April: finalize electronics and programming</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>Previous work:

2019: Transdimensional Portal Generator (The Pyramid)
A 12 foot pyramid with approx 4000 LEDs.  Appeared at multiple burns, been on a hiatus for a few years.  We are bringing it to Freezerburn this year!

2023: SunStreak
Ignition Philter funded solar powered LED light tower.  The Numbers Station is an evolution of many of the techniques used on SunStreak - along with a rejection of the full 3D printed tower (it was a huge pain in the butt!) - instead we are using a steel frame with laser cut wooden cladding to reduce cost, time to build (SunStreak was easily 200+ hours just in print time), and strength.  Sunstreak is approx 8 feet tall, 400 LEDs.

SunStreak's build technique and electronics are also deployed on a fleet of 6 solar powered LED spires, essentially smaller versions of SunStreak.</p>

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>$575</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>$400</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Description</h3>
            <p>We would either make it smaller, or just fund the rest ourselves.  Even at $575, we will be supplementing with our own funds and materials we already have on hand (see spreadsheet).</p>
