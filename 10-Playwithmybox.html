            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>This will be a 4-sided interactive LED piece. It will be off the ground 3 or 4 feet for optimum viewing and the over height will be 6 or 7 feet tall (each illuminated panel will be 3 feet x 3 feet on each of the 4 faces). Each side is capable of displaying different colors or patterns at the same time. There are 100 individually addressable LED nodes used on each side (total of 400). All of the LED nodes use ping pong balls as diffusers and each ball is held by a 3d printed ring and vinyl tubing to space the balls over the face of the panel. The 3d printer filament that I will be using has UV properties that make the ball supports glow when certain color light is selected.
I will incorporate push buttons so participants can toggle through different settings and patterns. The lighting is also capable of reacting to sound if there is a music source nearby. 
Additionally I will be able to integrate this piece with a display I created a couple years ago for one unique and fun time! 
The included photos show one completed panel in daylight mode, one with panel lit, and a closeup of the ping pong ball diffuser and 3d printed support ring.

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>I have a generator</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>** not provided **</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>In Progress (Making Changes)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>I have already completed the design and concept phases. At the moment I have one completed panel but would need the requested grant to complete the entire project and off-set what I have already invested. Please see the attached spreadsheet for what is already invested and kindly consider fully funding the grant if possible.
Installment on-site would take about 1-2 hours and same for removal. 
The project should not generate any MOOP but if it does it will be removed.</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>I sure have! In 2018 I made a giant (8ft x 8ft) light bright, 2019 was glow in the dark walls where participants used UV flashlights/lasers to draw on a phosphorescent background, 2022 Robo reckoning used 3 evil robo vacs to battle it out (using real knives and other pointy objects), race, and even bowl.
In 2023 I made 5 LED Disco Balls and it went great and I have continued (and will continue) to bring them out and display them. I learned how to carefully transport completed projects and make them easy to assemble and disassemble on-site. All of these art projects were completed for Flipside.</p>

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>450</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>320</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Description</h3>
            <p>2 panels vs 4. There are a lot of fixed costs like controller, power supply, fuel, power supply/controller enclosure so it is hard to cut the budget.</p>
