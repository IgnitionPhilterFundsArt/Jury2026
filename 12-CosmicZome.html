            <h1>12 - Cosmic Zome</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>The Cosmic Zome is a 13 foot tall, 20 foot diameter, projection-mapped zome that debuted at Flipside 2024.  Unlike traditional geodesic domes which are built out of triangles, a zome is a similar structure built from kite shapes instead of triangles.  This small twist creates a beautiful shape suggesting sacred geometry, with the top of the zome forming the petals of a flower.  The wooden frame is covered with 84 panels, and 4 projectors inside the zome create a 360 degree continuous video wall for visitors to enjoy.  Hundreds (thousands?) or Flipizens have stopped by to lay down and look up at the roof of the structure to relax and get lost in the immersive video experience.

The 2026 update to the Cosmic Zome will add a bass-reactive floor to the project.  When people lay down to enjoy the video show and music, they will also FEEL the music through 13 bass shakers installed under the floor.  Music will come from external sources (e.g. DJ stage music) as well as custom playlists (e.g. ambient bass music) designed to provide attendees with an even more amazing experience.</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>Quiet Honda generator provided by the artist.</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>n/a</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>In Progress (Making Changes)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>The zome walls / ceiling are complete.  Prototyping is already underway.  The floor will be fabricated by late February/early-March.

The project takes a team of 3 people approximately 12 hours to set up and will be done by Thursday night at Flipside, assuming early entry is granted.

Teardown takes a team of 3 people approximately 3 hours and will be done Monday at Flipside.  Everything is reusable, so no MOOP should remain.</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>The original version of the Cosmic Zome was built and displayed at Flipside 2024, and major updates to the project were displayed at Flipside 2025.  I have completed numerous other art projects in association with my camp, including projection mapping a box truck, two 8-foot tall LED towers, an 8 foot by 4 foot DJ booth facade, the 24-foot wide stage at our camp, and more.  This project is a straightforward update.  I don't foresee any issues.</p>

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>1000</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>$955.31</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Description</h3>
            <p>The budget can be reduced by using fewer bass shakers and amps.  13 should provide the best experience, but a reduced version with 7 is possible as well.  I can also just build the floor and install bass shakers in the future.</p>
