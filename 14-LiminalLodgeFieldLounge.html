            <h1>14 - Liminal Lodge Field Lounge</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>The Liminal Lodge Field Lounge is an outdoor expansion of the Liminal Lodge, an immersive retro ranger field station brought to life last year with the support of the Ignition Philter art grant. The Lodge was designed as a liminal space, part art installation and part community refuge, where people could explore surreal interactive elements while also finding shade, water, fans, and a welcoming place to rest. This year, the primary focus is to enhance the Lodge"s curb appeal and create a larger, more inviting threshold that clearly signals what kind of world visitors are stepping into. The Field Lounge extends that vision outward, opening up the front of the installation so more Flipizens can be drawn in, linger, and connect before even entering the Lodge itself.

The Field Lounge will be a semi screened patio built using a mix of structures we already own alongside high quality prefabricated canopies and screening products. By working smart with these modular systems, we can ensure reliable shade, airflow, and durability while keeping our energy focused on layered textures, set dressing, monumental signage, lighting, and storytelling elements that visually announce the identity of the space. These elements will frame the approach to the Lodge, making the experience feel intentional, immersive, and readable from the outside.

For Flipizens, the Field Lounge is meant to be both an artwork and a living social space. Visitors can wander through the environment, discover playful details, interact with installations, or simply relax in the ambiance. The space will also host a free self service grab and go market with water and small comforts, and will serve as a flexible venue for community programming, including pop up dining, tarot readings, tea gatherings, and immersive interdimensional experiences planned by camp members. Ultimately, the Liminal Lodge Field Lounge invites people to explore, refuel, congregate, and enjoy a shared, imaginative place together.</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>We will power the installation using a mix of solar battery systems and a large gas generator dedicated to the installation. We are renting a golf cart and will have fuel on hand so our camp can easily check in, refuel, and keep things running throughout the event. Because the Lounge is located next to our camp, it will be simple for us to maintain and care for the power setup.</p>

            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>        �        The Liminal Lodge, Flipside 2025
The Liminal Lodge was an immersive, walk-through art environment that blended retro field-station aesthetics with interactive storytelling, small-scale installations, and a public-facing mutual-aid element providing shade, water, and fans. The project was widely used as a social gathering space as well as an exploratory artwork. The biggest lessons from this piece were the importance of strong curb appeal, clearer visual invitation from the exterior, and the need for more shaded outdoor space to welcome visitors before they entered the interior experience. I also learned how powerfully art can function as a venue for community events and shared experiences.
        �        Six sci-fi installations, Flipside 2024
In 2024, I led the concept, design, and fabrication of six interconnected sci-fi-themed installations across the event. Each piece combined visual storytelling, set dressing, and interactive elements to create narrative environments for participants to explore. From this body of work, I learned the value of designing art that can be reused and evolved over multiple years, investing in durable infrastructure, and consolidating resources to make future builds more efficient and sustainable.
        �        Product Runway, Houston 2022
Product Runway is a design competition in which architecture professionals create wearable garments from unconventional materials. For the 2022 theme �Vacation Destinations,� I led a team that produced a three-look ensemble inspired by Bora Bora using architectural and found materials. The project won Best in Show and Best Newcomer. This experience reinforced the power of material experimentation, collaborative making, and trusting a creative team to push ideas beyond what one person could achieve alone.
        �        Professional practice as a Project Architect
In my professional work, I lead large-scale architectural projects from concept through construction. This requires translating complex ideas into clear, buildable systems, coordinating multidisciplinary teams, and balancing creativity with technical precision. These skills directly inform my art practice, especially when working with temporary structures, large installations, and public spaces where safety, logistics, and experience must work together seamlessly.</p>

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>$1,000</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>$575</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Description</h3>
            <p>If awarded $575, we would focus grant funds on the essential pieces that make the Liminal Lodge Field Lounge work as a public art space: basic canopy structure, screening for shade and airflow, and the core lighting that defines the space at night. These elements are what make the patio safe, functional, and clearly readable as an intentional artwork rather than just camp infrastructure.

To make this work at a reduced award, we would scale back on non-essential decorative items like extra rugs, textiles, props, and finer details on the neon sign, billboard, and CRT wall. Those aesthetic layers would be added later through self-funding from our camp. Water, hydration, and community giveaways would remain fully camp-funded as part of our gifting practice, and all grant dollars would be used strictly for building and developing the art space itself.</p>
