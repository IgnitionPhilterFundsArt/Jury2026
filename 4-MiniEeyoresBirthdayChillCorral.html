            <h1>4 - Mini Eeyore's Birthday Chill Corral</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>Mini Eeyore"s Birthday Chill Corral is a soft, sprawling installation that brings the unmistakable spirit of Austin"s annual Eeyore"s Birthday Party to Flipside. A large sturdy pop-up tent shelters a huge tarp, a colorful oversized rug, and several giant handmade pillows large enough for multiple Flipizens to lounge on together.
Among the oversized pillows, several feature handmade Eeyore artistic details: floppy fabric ears in soft grays and pinks, and detachable pink yarn tails with bells"crafted from felt, yarn, and fabric scraps. Flipizens can customize and attach these tails at a dedicated station, recreating Eeyore"s playful 'tail replacement' tradition, transforming the pillows into interactive, communal art pieces that grow wavier and more whimsical over the weekend.
The crafting area includes materials to make colorful festival pasties: a make-your-own pastie station celebrating the body-positive spirit of the event.
A small battery-powered speaker provides mellow drum-circle loops that would not drown out an actual drum circle that attendees will be very welcome to partake in, and warm LED lights create a soft nighttime glow. The installation offers a shady rest zone, communal crafting nook, and playful cultural homage to an iconic Austin tradition.

            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>I have completed several large-scale art installations and murals involving spatial planning, flow, materials, and visitor interaction. These works taught me to design welcoming environments that balance structure and open-ended play, and to manage large, evolving communal art spaces.</p>
