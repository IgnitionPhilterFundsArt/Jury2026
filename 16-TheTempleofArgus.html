            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>The Temple of Argus
Whether it"s to honor our lost loved ones, to mourn and or remember pieces of ourselves we have left behind, commemorate change and the passage of time, or just have some time and space to hold dear our memories, together and apart, there are many reasons our community benefits from having, and burning, a Temple at the event. 

One of our lost loved ones also happened to be a long term resident of Pyropolis, with two decades under his belt, as well as a previous effigy lead and general DaFTie. Before he passed, he had begun a new effigy design proposal in the form of a large bunny and we will ensure that a scaled down version makes it to the event this year. He had named the bunny Argus. 

Argus will be defiantly and majestically sitting up on his haunches atop an empty but enclosed pedestal that will have a slot for people to put keepsakes and more private memories/notes inside the base, to become one with the temple. The space leading up to The Temple of Argus will involve a spiral path, providing visitors the time and space they desire to reflect, remember, and process their thoughts and grief as they make their way to Argus.

Grief takes many forms. Although we are honoring all of our losses, we thought that giving this Temple the specific form of Argus felt right and will give us the space we need to feel our feels about all of the things. 

We will be making open calls to help work on The Temple during build and onsite. It is meant to be a piece by the community and for the community. We are asking for some assistance with the cost of building materials. 

Please note that while a great deal of work has been put into this proposal and solid
plans for the direction of the project are in place, this design is still very much in
progress, and additional materials may be required, and the actual design will evolve (although keeping the course of the intent and what is being submitted). For example- The arches included in one of the images will likely look differently or be removed if we are unable to settle on the best way to proceed.

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>Per Art AF, we will tie in to effigy field power</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>** not provided **</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>The Temple of Argus is currently in its final design phase. Build will occur in late February, March and early April. We will coordinate with the art logistics for installment and will follow the burn leave no trace plan (scraping the burn scar, etc). It is designed to be a burnable piece and our team is already speaking with the appropriate art and safety volunteers to make this go, and to ensure the temple is built according to the burnable art requirements and coordinate with site sign off to ensure complete removal of ash, fasteners, etc. </p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>Yes. The core team is mainly past and present DaFTies (most of whom have worked on the past 8 years of effigies for this event, with a couple former DaFT leads participating), event volunteers, and OG citizens of Pyropolis. There is a *lot* of collective experience and people who have run large burnable projects that have learned valuable lessons about scalability, scope creep, and logistics. </p>

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>1000</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>No minimum- some version of this will come out</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Description</h3>
            <p>No matter what, this project will come to Flipside so any and all help would be appreciated as lumber costs are high.  The arches would be a stretch goal- the bunny and the cube it�s mounted to are the bare minimum of what would be brought out. We will try to build this as complete as possible no matter the amount we receive (or not) from the grant process. </p>
