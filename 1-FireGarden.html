            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>I have two propane art pieces plus a main field camp/installation that I am requesting assistance for.  The assistance is for the trailer rental for getting the two art pieces plus the installation's (aka Fire Garden's) infrastructure.  One of the art pieces is 'Mammatus', which is a 10' disc suspended at 12' in the air making a rolling flame ceiling.  The other art piece is 'Vortex' which is a flame tornado between 6' - 12' depending on wind and other factors.  fire Garden also requires a generator, the entry arch, tools for repair, etc. to be hauled out.  The trailer rental is approximately $300, Mammatus will burn about 250 lbs of propane and Vortex will burn about 150 lbs of propane.  The genny will burn another 20-40 lbs.  So 400-500 lbs (say 100 gallons) of propane at something like $3/gallon is another $300.  I can cover $200 of that, $400 would be extremely helpful.  Fire Garden sits adjacent to the effigy and has multiple fire artists showing propane art on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights so that burners don't have to wander around hoping they'll find the cool propane art, they know where to go.</p>

            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I have brought flame effects both smaller and larger than this project to Burning Flipside since 2007.  I have learned a great deal about designing for transport and setup/teardown.  I have also brought large scale flame art to Maker Faires and other Art festivals.  </p>
